# 🌟 Project Goal

Solve a challenging image recognition problem by incorporating image processing tools discussed in class. Consider using state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for solving the image recognition task.

# 📌 Overview

This project explores core concepts in **Digital Image Processing**, enhanced with **image classification techniques**. The objective is to build a system that not only improves image quality through pre-processing techniques but also accurately classifies images into relevant categories based on extracted features. This end-to-end pipeline deepens understanding of both theoretical and practical aspects of image processing in real-world applications.

# 📦 Project Components

### 1. Pre-processing

* **Noise reduction**: Using filters such as Gaussian and Median.
* **Image enhancement**: Techniques like histogram equalization and contrast stretching.

### 2. Feature Extraction

* Extract relevant features using methods such as texture analysis and shape descriptors.

### 3. Classification

* Apply classification algorithms.
* Train classifiers on extracted features and labeled datasets.

### 4. Post-processing

* Evaluate using metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.
* Perform model tuning to improve performance.
